# BurpProxy
SimplePlugin To switch proxy ON/OFF


By default most of the proxies (Including Burp ) runs on 127.0.0.1:8080 , and we been to a place where we needed the proxy to be turned  on/off frequently ,
Hence the plugin . On enabling it , it changes the browser proxy setting to 127.0.0.1:8080 (for Both HTTP/HTTPS ) , You can add your own desired protocols .

PS You do need to have the certificate from the proxy imported into the browser .
